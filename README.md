# mern-tutorial

Tihs is a fullstack Mern goal setting app I made in react. The app uses mongoDB, Redux, JWT etc. This app was made by me in 2022 but fixed and deployed april 2023. I used this tutorial from Traversy Media: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbbQeVSccR9PGKHzPJSWqcsm

To start the app you need to npm install both inside the frontend and backend folder, and then run the concurrently command npm run dev. The .env file is not uploaded.
